Peterhouse offers a wide variety of student-run clubs and societies — from sports and academic groups to political, gaming, and expressive arts societies. Everyone is welcome to join as many societies or teams as they like, and each group strives to create a friendly and fun atmosphere.

These clubs and societies provide fantastic opportunities to try something new, meet people in college, and enjoy a (hopefully!) well-earned break from work.

During Freshers' Week, there will be an event where you can explore what’s on offer and sign up. However, you’re welcome to join at any time or reach out to a society's president or team captain to find out more.

There’s already a great range of options available, but if you’re interested in starting a new club or society, that’s absolutely possible. The Amals (Amalgamated Clubs) committee is always happy to help with any questions.

📧 For any queries about sports or societies, contact our current AMALs President — Arlo Alexander (aa2627@cam.ac.uk).
